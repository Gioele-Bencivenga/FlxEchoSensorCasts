# FlxEchoSensorCasts

A project where I try to simulate some entities in an environment that use echo linecasts as periodic environment sensors.

Built using [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) + [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) + [Echo Physics](https://austineast.dev/echo/) + [HaxeUI](http://www.haxeui.org/).

## Live Build - Broken :(

Check out the [latest html5 build of the project](https://Gioele-Bencivenga.github.io/FlxEchoSensorCasts) if you want, but know that it may be broken and/or stuck to an older version of the project.
