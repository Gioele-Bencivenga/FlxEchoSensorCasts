# TilemapGen

A project where I try to simulate some autonomous entities in an environment.

Built using Haxe + HaxeFlixel + Echo (physics) + HaxeUI (interface).

The entities will eventually move guided by a neural network and reproduce according to genetic algorithms.

## Live Build - Broken :(

Check out the [latest html5 build of the project](https://Gioele-Bencivenga.github.io/TilemapGen) if you want, but know that it may be broken or unusable.
